# VSCode GraphQL

GraphQL extension VSCode built with the aim to tightly integrate the GraphQL Ecosystem with VSCode for an awesome developer experience.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** This extension no longer supports `.prisma` files. If you are using this extension with GraphQL 1, please rename your datamodel from `datamodel.prisma` to `datamodel.graphql` and this extension will pick that up.

## Features

Lots of new improvements happening! We now have a [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/graphql/vscode-graphql/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log)

### General features

- Load the extension on detecting `graphql-config file` at root level or in a parent level directory
- Load the extension in `.graphql`, `.gql files`
- Load the extension on detecting `gql` tag in js, ts, jsx, tsx, vue files
- execute query/mutation/subscription operation, embedded or in graphql files
- pre-load schema and document defintitions
- Support [`graphql-config`](https://graphql-config.com/) files with one project and multiple projects
- the language service re-starts on changes to vscode settings and/or graphql config!

### `.graphql`, `.gql` file extension support

- syntax highlighting (type, query, mutation, interface, union, enum, scalar, fragments, directives)
- autocomplete suggestions
- validation against schema
- snippets (interface, type, input, enum, union)
- hover support
- go to definition support (input, enum, type)
- outline support

### `gql`/`graphql` tagged template literal support for tsx, jsx, ts, js

- syntax highlighting (type, query, mutation, interface, union, enum, scalar, fragments, directives)
- autocomplete suggestions
- validation against schema
- snippets
- hover support
- go to definition for fragments and input types
- outline support

## Usage

Install the [VSCode GraphQL Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql).

(Watchman is no longer required, you can uninstall it now)

**This extension requires a graphql-config file**.

As of `vscode-graphql@0.3.0` we support `graphql-config@3`. You can read more about that [here](https://graphql-config.com/usage). Because it now uses `cosmicconfig` there are plenty of new options for loading config files:

```
graphql.config.json
graphql.config.js
graphql.config.yaml
graphql.config.yml
.graphqlrc (YAML or JSON)
.graphqlrc.json
.graphqlrc.yaml
.graphqlrc.yml
.graphqlrc.js
graphql property in package.json
```

the file needs to be placed at the project root by default, but you can configure paths per project. see the FAQ below for details.

Previous versions of this extension support `graphql-config@2` format, which follows [legacy configuration patterns](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-config/tree/legacy#usage)

To support language features like "go-to definition" across multiple files, please include `documents` key in the graphql-config default or /per project (this was `include` in 2.0).

## Configuration Examples

### Simple Example

```js
// .graphqlrc.yml
schema: "schema.graphql"
documents: "src/**/*.{graphql,js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
```

### Advanced Example

```js
// graphql.config.js
module.exports = {
  projects: {
    app: {
      schema: ["src/schema.graphql", "directives.graphql"],
      documents: ["**/*.{graphql,js,ts,jsx,tsx}", "my/fragments.graphql"],
      endpoints: {
        default: {
          url: "http://localhost:8000",
          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` },
        },
      },
    },
    db: {
      schema: "src/generated/db.graphql",
      documents: ["src/db/**/*.graphql", "my/fragments.graphql"],
      extensions: {
        codegen: [
          {
            generator: "graphql-binding",
            language: "typescript",
            output: {
              binding: "src/generated/db.ts",
            },
          },
        ],
        endpoints: {
          default: {
            url: "http://localhost:8080",
            headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Notice that `documents` key supports glob pattern and hence `["**/*.graphql"]` is also valid.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Go to definition is using `generated_schema.graphql`, not my schema source files

Ah yes, this is now the default behavior used by most users, who do not have source SDL files.
If you're using an "SDL first" methodology, such as with apollo, you'll want to enable `useSchemaFileDefinitions`.
Add this to your settings:

```json
"vscode-graphql.useSchemaFileDefinitions": true,
```

you can also use graphql config if you need to mix and match these settings:

```yml
projects:
  project1:
    schema: project1/schema/schema.graphql
    documents: project1/queries/**/*.{graphql,tsx,jsx,ts,js}
    extensions:
      languageService:
        useSchemaFileDefinitions: true
  project2:
    schema: https://api.spacex.land/graphql/
    documents: project2/queries.graphql
    extensions:
      endpoints:
        default:
          url: https://api.spacex.land/graphql/
```

### The extension fails with errors about duplicate types

Make sure that you aren't including schema files in the `documents` blob

### The extension fails with errors about missing scalars, directives, etc

Make sure that your `schema` pointers refer to a complete schema!

### In JSX and TSX files I see completion items I don't need

The way vscode lets you filter these out is [on the user end](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/45039)

So you'll need to add something like this to your global vscode settings:

```json
"[typescriptreact]": {
  "editor.suggest.filteredTypes": {
    "snippet": false
  }
},
"[javascriptreact]": {
  "editor.suggest.filteredTypes": {
    "snippet": false
  }
}
```

### "Execute Query/Mutation/Subscription" always fails

The best way to make "execute <op type>" codelens work is to add endpoints config to the global graphql config or the project config.

The config example above shows how to configure endpoints.

If there is an issue with execution that has to do with your server, the error response should show now in the results panel

### My graphql config file is not at the root

Good news, we have configs for this now!

You can search a folder for any of the matching config file names listed above:

```json
"graphql-config.load.baseDir": "./config"
```

Or a specific filepath:

```json
"graphql-config.load.filePath": "./config/my-graphql-config.js"
```

Or a different `configName` that allows different formats:

```json
"graphql-config.load.baseDir": "./config",
"graphql-config.load.configName": "acme"
```

which would search for `./config/.acmerc`, `.config/.acmerc.js`, `.config/acme.config.json`, etc matching the config paths above

If you have multiple projects, you need to define one top-level config that defines all project configs using `projects`

### How do I highlight an embedded graphql string

If you aren't using a template tag function, and just want to use a plain string, you can use an inline `#graphql` comment:

```ts
const myQuery = `#graphql
  query {
    something
  }
`
```

or

```ts
const myQuery = `
  #graphql
  query {
    something
  }
`
```

## Known Issues

- template replacement inside a graphql string [will break graphql parsing](https://github.com/graphql/vscode-graphql/issues/137). If you want to help improve partial parsing support, you can contribute to the parser efforts in [`graphql`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation. You can now re-use fragments across your project source, if you include the files in `documents`.
- the output channel occasionally shows "definition not found" when you first start the language service, but once the definition cache is built for each project, definition lookup will work. so if a "peek definition" fails when you first start, just try clicking it again.

## Development

This plugin uses the [GraphQL language server](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-language-service-server)

1.  Clone the repository - https://github.com/graphql/vscode-graphql
1.  `npm install`
1.  Open it in VSCode
1.  Go to the debugging section and run the launch program "Extension"
1.  This will open another VSCode instance with extension enabled
1.  Open a project with a graphql config file - ":electric_plug: graphql" in VSCode status bar indicates that the extension is in use
1.  Logs for GraphQL language service will appear in output section under GraphQL Language Service
